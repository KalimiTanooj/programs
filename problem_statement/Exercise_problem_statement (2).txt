# problem statement given by batch no:4


##Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
##
##You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
##
##You can return the answer in any order.
##
## 
##
##Example 1:
##
##Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
##Output: [0,1]
##Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
##Example 2:
##
##Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
##Output: [1,2]
##Example 3:
##
##Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
##Output: [0,1]
